It is a Backend for Course selling platform .<br>
Express.js was used for the server.<br>
MondoDb was used for the Database.<br>
JWT token was used so that we dont store original passwords directly in the database.<br>
I also used .env file to keep the JWT passwords secure before pushing them to any public repository.<br>
I created custom middleware for every endpoint which check the token which was issued to the user during SignIn.<br>
The backend is fully tested using Postman.<br>

I need to work on Frontend for this application.<br>
